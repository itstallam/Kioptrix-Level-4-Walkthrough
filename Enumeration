From our previous scan we can see that port 22, 80, 139 and 445 are open.

We head over to port 80 and see what we have. http://192.168.56.15:80

We have a webpage with a login form. Since we don't have any usernames we can create one or use a tool

Enum4Linux.

Command is as follows:
-$ enum4linux 192.168.56.15

See Enum4linux.png for the results.

We find the results like so,

user:[nobody] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[robert] rid:[0xbbc]
user:[root] rid:[0x3e8]
user:[john] rid:[0xbba]
user:[loneferret] rid:[0xbb8]

You "cat" the result and you get
robert
root
john
loneferret

Now we can head back on the webpage http://192.168.56.10

Put one of the username. My case I used "john". In the password box, we can try to perform
different SQLi Attacks. After several trials the    ' OR 1=1#    works and we can see John's password (MyNameIsJohn)
